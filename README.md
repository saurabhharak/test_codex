## Autogen Agent with r.jina.ai

This repository includes a simple Python script `rjina_agent.py` that leverages [AG2's pyautogen](https://ag2.ai/) library. The agent fetches text content from any URL using the **r.jina.ai** proxy, which converts webpages into a format suitable for LLM processing. It then summarizes that content using an Autogen assistant.

### Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogen requests
   ```
   You also need an OpenAI API key available as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. Run the agent with a URL:
   ```bash
   python rjina_agent.py https://example.com
   ```
   The script will retrieve the page through `https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com` and output a summary generated by the LLM.
